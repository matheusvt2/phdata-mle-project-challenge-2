## Project Overview

**Client:** Sound Realty (Seattle Area Real Estate)
**Problem:** Manual property valuation is time-consuming and inefficient
**Solution:** Deploy ML model as REST API to streamline business operations

---

## Business Context

- **Current State:** Staff spends excessive time estimating property values
- **Opportunity:** Basic ML model shows promise as proof of concept
- **Goal:** Deploy model for broader business use
- **Deliverable:** REST endpoint + guidance for model improvement

---

## Technical Requirements

✅ **Deploy model as REST endpoint**
- Accept JSON POST data
- Return predictions + metadata
- Auto-enrich with demographic data
- Scale without service interruption
- Support model versioning

✅ **Create test script**
- Demonstrate endpoint functionality
- Use real data examples

✅ **Evaluate model performance**
- Assess generalization capability
- Identify improvement opportunities

## Architecture Overview

**Two Deployment Solutions:**

1. **Solution A:** AWS Lambda + API Gateway (Serverless)
2. **Solution B:** Amazon ECS + Application Load Balancer (Container-based)

---

## Solution A: Serverless Architecture

**Components:**
- API Gateway → Lambda → Model
- Auto-scaling by request volume
- Pay-per-request pricing
- Estimated cost: ~$360/month

**Pros:** Lower cost, automatic scaling, pay-per-use
**Cons:** Cold start latency, size limitations, potential cost escalation

---

## Solution B: Container Architecture

**Components:**
- API Gateway → ALB → ECS → Model
- Horizontal scaling with custom metrics
- Model versioning via environment variables
- Estimated cost: ~$1,455/month

**Pros:** Highly scalable, better performance, model/code separation
**Cons:** Higher cost, complex autoscaling, resource management

---

## Implementation Details

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/predict` - Full feature set
- `/api/v1/predict/minimal` - Required features only

**Data Flow:**
- Client request → API → Model prediction → Response
- Automatic demographic data enrichment
- Request/response logging for monitoring

---

## Model Architecture

**Current Model:**
- Algorithm: KNeighborsRegressor
- Features: Numeric variables + demographics
- Training: 80/20 train-test split
- Validation: Holdout test set evaluation

**Metrics Tracked:**
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)

---

## Deployment Strategy

**Model Versioning:**
- Environment variable configuration
- Support for multiple model versions
